TODO continue editing at 00:25:01
well this is dr. Stan here at Radio

2
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,099
Liberty coming differen the hills

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,010
overlooking beautiful and picturesque

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,130
Monterey Bay and bringing you the story

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,439
behind the story the news behind the

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,560
news hoping to convince you that reality

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,960
is usually scoffed at and allusion is

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,730
usually king but in the battle for

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,099
survival of Western civilization it's

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,590
going to be reality and not illusion or

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,760
delusion that's going to determine just

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,219
what the future will bring now I want to

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,620
introduce to you dr. Lawrence Dunnigan

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,050
and dr. Dunnigan is a pediatrician he

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,899
practice in Pittsburgh practices in the

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,660
eastern part of the United States and

17
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,079
he's been practicing in for 30 years but

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,770
some 28 years ago he heard a fascinating

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,230
lecture given by a dr. day who had been

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,059
a professor at the Medical School he had

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,280
attended and this talk was given to a

22
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,290
group of young doctors and with the

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,960
proviso that nobody would take notes and

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,090
nobody would record what was said dr.

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,450
day then went on to become a director of

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,119
the Planned Parenthood Federation so now

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,189
right now let's introduce dr. denigan

28
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,450
dr. Dunnigan so good for you to be where

29
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,909
they start to have you with us today

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,860
my pleasure all right fine well why

31
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,840
don't you just give our listeners the

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,049
background of this incredible incredible

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,570
story you heard 28 years ago which is so

34
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,820
prophetic as far as what's unfolding

35
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,280
today and let me just for the listener a

36
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,220
comment that one of the things that was

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,070
said 28 years ago was we would have sex

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,110
without reproduction and reproduction

39
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,850
without sex and as we begin thinking

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,610
about the artificial insemination and

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,180
now the new cloning process you realize

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:57,689
that what was said 28 years ago to a

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,780
young pediatrician is all coming to pass

44
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,240
today a part of a long-range plan of a

45
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,770
group of men who do have an agenda so

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,149
why don't you pick up the story from

47
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,580
there well when we sat down to listen to

48
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,230
the lecture we were all expecting

49
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,209
something clinical

50
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,280
dr. dey his areas of primary research

51
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:25,909
concern had always been newborn

52
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,799
premature birth and the problems with

53
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,150
kernicterus

54
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:33,420
coming from neonatal jaundice and

55
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,390
temperature control in premature babies

56
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:41,060
so what we were all expecting something

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:45,720
scientific and as the presentation

58
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,069
unfold it was quite a surprise because

59
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,569
there was nothing scientific it was all

60
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:56,299
of what we might call sociologic and as

61
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:58,769
you alluded a while ago dr. day and

62
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:02,480
indicated that he wanted to see nobody

63
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:05,459
taking notes or using a tape recorder

64
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,849
because the things he was going to talk

65
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,069
about actually he said in the process if

66
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,859
you ever quote me on these things I will

67
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:17,160
deny them he seemed to be indicating

68
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:21,060
that there could be some sort of

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,470
physical danger to him for speaking out

70
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,630
about such things that was for ace

71
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:32,459
suggests that I think rather than an

72
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,340
explicit statement but you know we hear

73
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,389
that sort of thing very early enough

74
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,910
what you're anticipating to be a

75
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,200
scientific presentation that really

76
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,930
caught my attention you know what are

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,239
you going to be telling us that could

78
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,489
put you in some danger one way or

79
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:57,590
another so anyway as the presentation

80
00:03:50,489 --> 00:04:00,299
unfolded he began by stating that

81
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,500
anybody with an eighth grade education

82
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:08,540
could do the arithmetic and determine

83
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:13,199
that the earth would soon be

84
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:18,570
overpopulated if there were no limits

85
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:20,519
put on human reproduction and part pulse

86
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,400
of the overpopulation then would be

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,889
outgrowing our natural resources and

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,990
over pollution of the planet

89
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:33,330
these people always refer to the world

90
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:36,409
or the earth is the planet so in the

91
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,749
beginning it seemed as though

92
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:44,759
presentation was almost an apology for

93
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:47,789
things that we would in the audience

94
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,680
find unpalatable but there were several

95
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:52,199
times in presentation where he would say

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:58,710
this is the only way there's no other

97
00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:03,229
way this is sort of implying that he

98
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:06,090
knew these things would maybe not sound

99
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:12,740
acceptable to many if not all in the

100
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:15,569
audience so the thing that he really

101
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:19,439
this whole thing hung on was population

102
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:21,060
control and up until that time I had

103
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,469
heard most of us had heard that term

104
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:31,199
population control to me it primarily

105
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:33,839
meant limiting births by the end of the

106
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,500
presentation I realized that population

107
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:41,159
control has a much much broader meaning

108
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,589
than just limiting number of births and

109
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:46,560
even who or who may not be allowed to

110
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:50,539
give birth because the presentation

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,300
covered just every human endeavor

112
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:58,729
education employment industry

113
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,139
entertainment sports toys for children

114
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,779
clothing a whole bunch of things that

115
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:11,180
maybe we can get into as week one hears

116
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:13,770
as time allows but mentioning as you did

117
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,779
six without reproduction and

118
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,129
reproduction without sex that was they

119
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:22,649
an important part of this also money in

120
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:27,960
banking which was toward the end of his

121
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:33,419
presentation the cashless society moved

122
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:35,639
from cash to credit cards to a single

123
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,020
credit card to a single identifying

124
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,160
court

125
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:46,110
and only had to end because cards can be

126
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,060
lost or stolen some sort of implant

127
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,849
under the skin in those days silicone

128
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:57,900
implants were under the very first

129
00:06:53,849 --> 00:07:01,319
stages of development silicone is inert

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:07,979
so the body tends to tolerate it fairly

131
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:12,840
well in this implant them would serve as

132
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:17,729
identification and be an element in

133
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:21,360
carrying on Commerce which as I say

134
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:24,479
would replace cash replace Chuck's from

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,650
a checking account replace plastic

136
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,810
credit cards which back at that time

137
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:41,009
we're starting to really accelerate in

138
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:45,120
use so that all of these items that

139
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:48,960
serve your financial banking needs also

140
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,110
would serve for identification and this

141
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,380
could be implanted laughing because at

142
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,419
the time he said some of you hearing

143
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,409
this will right away think there is a

144
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,509
religious connotation here and at that

145
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:06,360
time I had no idea what he's referring

146
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:09,060
to I was not much of a Bible scholar and

147
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:14,909
then it was only later that I read the

148
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:16,590
book of the apocalypse about the the

149
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:19,229
market based on the hand to the forehead

150
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,020
and I made a connection then I realized

151
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:24,740
why he said what he says did he tell you

152
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,330
what the relationship was to banking and

153
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,090
international finance or was this just a

154
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,570
casual remark about the fact that we

155
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,070
would progress to a situation or society

156
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:43,529
where everybody would be marked and

157
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:45,980
identified yeah he went the presentation

158
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,290
was that

159
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,220
the changes that he was projecting from

160
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,920
then 1969 the target date to have them

161
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:58,040
all in place was the turn of the century

162
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,269
the 2000 right uh you ever take a few

163
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,680
years according to how well it would

164
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,500
progress but there was where they were

165
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,380
shooting and this was the worldwide not

166
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,610
just the United States or not just

167
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,160
United States Europe and you know

168
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,070
so-called Western civilization but this

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,720
was to be global the entire world now

170
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,639
did he tell you who was going to be

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,470
doing it or was it just it's going to

172
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:22,550
happen and and there's some group behind

173
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:24,589
this it's going to happen there he never

174
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:28,040
used a proper noun he used only one

175
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:30,110
proper down in the entire presentation

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,420
yeah and that it was the Rockefeller

177
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,940
Institute now what was the tie of the

178
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,500
Rockefeller Institute into this now did

179
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:43,160
he say that had to do with the research

180
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,930
and the treatment of cancer and there

181
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,699
was something about they had treatments

182
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,709
for cancer but they didn't want to

183
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,750
release them because we had to have

184
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:55,640
people dying off what was that yes

185
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:58,130
that's just about what it was that many

186
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,250
or most cancers now could be cured now

187
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:04,510
this is back in 1969 many are most

188
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:08,660
cancer is now or curable but the

189
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:11,660
information has been held in Rockefeller

190
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,760
Institute files because imagine what

191
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,740
would happen if people stopped dying of

192
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,470
cancer. - and of course that's exactly what

193
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,329
Thomas Malthus wrote about back in 1800

194
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:23,560
you know we had to have people dying so

195
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:26,420
we could have new people born. mm-hmm

196
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,740
fascinating. okay well just I pardon me

197
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,709
for interrupting you but I just wanted

198
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,870
to bring that fact out so this is 28

199
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,480
years ago you're hearing the predictions

200
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,269
of what the future holds for the world

201
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,269
so why don't you pick it up from there.

202
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,269
- well

203
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm just trying to recall where he

204
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:57,490
started, there was this general overview

205
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:59,680
about controlling earth/birth, who may or may

206
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,200
not be allowed to have birth, implying

207
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,930
that certain people would be not allowed

208
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:08,800
to have children, most people would be

209
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:11,970
allowed to exceptional people might be

210
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,660
allowed three, but never more than that

211
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:21,780
the replacement statistic that is why

212
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:27,130
they quoted as 2.1 births per couple,

213
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:29,890
the 0.1 meaning you know to two would

214
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,540
replace the two parents and then the

215
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,430
point one is because of some untimely

216
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,650
deaths of disease or accident or

217
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:42,790
whatever, so replacement levels felt to

218
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:47,500
be just a little above two. in that

219
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:52,500
context too, he mentioned that something we

220
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:56,320
feel that we can accelerate and control

221
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:00,100
evolution, and this was in a context of

222
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,610
controlling who might be allowed

223
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,130
to reproduce. in other words, if your

224
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,470
genes were acceptable, you would be

225
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,440
allowed to bear children. but if they

226
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:19,150
were not, you might be forbidden to bear

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:20,920
children. that's when the the business

228
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,880
about sex without babies, and babies

229
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,790
without sex

230
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:30,880
got some development, in that certain

231
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:33,300
people who had desirable genetic

232
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,860
characteristics that should be

233
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,860
perpetuated for the good of the world,

234
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,080
could be / would be encouraged to

235
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,330
reproduce, but they need not reproduce in

236
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,880
the in the natural way, through sexual

237
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,660
intercourse, that this could be all done

238
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,660
in the laboratory.

239
00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:05,029
then, and along those lines, is a question

240
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,370
which he anticipated by the way, I should

241
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,259
say we there was no opportunity for any

242
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,889
of us in the audience to ask any

243
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:15,230
questions,

244
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:17,899
but because the sexual instincts are so

245
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:21,889
strong, he said, you might think that at

246
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:25,430
first we would try to de-emphasize sex,

247
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:28,699
but that's nearly impossible to do,

248
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:31,180
because the feelings are strong, so

249
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:35,629
the plan is to go the other way, to

250
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:39,170
encourage sexual activity, to promote

251
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:41,829
sexual desire, but do it in such a way,

252
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:47,930
that it's directed away from

253
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:53,089
reproduction, and hard parcel that then

254
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:57,319
was the promotion of contraceptive

255
00:13:53,089 --> 00:14:00,680
devices, they would be promoted in such a

256
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:02,959
way, that it would be just instinctive

257
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,839
and natural, that when you were thinking

258
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:11,540
about sex, you would automatically

259
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:15,500
connect it to contraception, that sex

260
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:17,930
without contraception would be sort of a

261
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,540
deliberate mental process, but most

262
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,819
sexual activity would be linked to

263
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,059
contraception. now how do you do that?

264
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:28,790
well, sex education in the schools. - and

265
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:31,699
was he talking about sex education, and

266
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:34,519
its importance back then in 1969? - oh yeah,

267
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:37,339
yeah, he developed that, to some

268
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:42,559
extent, that this would be taught in the

269
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:48,050
schools, kids would be taught to see the

270
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:51,769
the birth control pill was 69... birth

271
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:53,540
control pill came in about... - it was

272
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:59,180
around in the early 60s, was in the mid

273
00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:02,809
60s. - yeah early to middle 60s, and, so this

274
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,130
was all fairly new stuff, and of

275
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,240
course he talked about things that had

276
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,940
been around a while,

277
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,020
condoms and diaphragms, but this would be

278
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,850
taught in the schools, the use of these. I

279
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,029
remember that particularly, because as he

280
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,330
was saying this, I was recalling some of

281
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:22,970
my teachers from high school, say "oh

282
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:26,240
I can remember Mrs. So-and-so..." you

283
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,589
know, she would never feel, that she

284
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
could talk about these things, of course

285
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:34,880
I was thinking of one of my algebra

286
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,610
teachers. - Hahaha. - He was talking about

287
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,020
something entirely different. But, you

288
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,899
know, there was a connection I made in my

289
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,070
mind, that in my high school, this never

290
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,500
would have gotten off the ground.

291
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,770
- Now, you were frantically taking notes

292
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,520
during this lecture on napkins that

293
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:53,779
you had, and so that nobody would

294
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,610
realize you were taking notes, because

295
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:57,320
you'd been asked not to, but you sensed

296
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,220
that this was important, so you were

297
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:04,250
recording this for posterity at the time.

298
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,589
- Yes, many of the things that he said, I

299
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,740
had heard before from

300
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:14,329
other sources, primarily from one source, which

301
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:17,870
I considered to be unreliable, and I had

302
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,670
heard it at length with some repetition,

303
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,649
to the point where actually it became

304
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:26,570
annoying to me, and I dismissed it,

305
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,270
because I considered the source not

306
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:32,600
reliable, and here it was a few years

307
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:35,600
later. See, the first I had heard it was

308
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,250
from this viewpoint, I stand out here

309
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,520
seeing over there that there's a

310
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,620
conspiracy going on, it's very broad

311
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,459
based, it's very pervasive, it's very

312
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:50,959
subtle, nobody knows it, and only a few of

313
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:54,440
us, who are able to see this, know what's

314
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,380
going on. Well, I dismissed that. Well

315
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:01,100
then here in 1969, I heard, from the other

316
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,690
end, I'm part of it, I know what's going

317
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,929
on, I've been told what's going on, I've

318
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:11,300
been privy to certain privileged

319
00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:13,970
information, and here it is... so, you know,

320
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,699
hearing all this stuff from a different

321
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,319
perspective, I'm not an outsider looking

322
00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:22,939
in, I'm an insider

323
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:27,139
speaking out the window to you, believe me,

324
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:31,009
that had quite an impact. So, that most of

325
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:35,600
the things he said I had heard before,

326
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:39,850
and then as the talk unfolded, and quite

327
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,529
frankly, was offensive in many ways to me,

328
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,279
it wasn't things that I was hearing for

329
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:48,259
the first time, but rather confirming

330
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:51,019
some things that I had heard before, like

331
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:55,730
the relocation of industries, breaking

332
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:57,889
down our armed forces, shipping our jobs

333
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,580
overseas, so that unemployment would go

334
00:17:57,889 --> 00:18:03,889
up... those were some things, that I had heard

335
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,419
before, and would not believe. - but, of

336
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:07,490
course, one of the things he talked about

337
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:10,009
was, how we were going to encourage

338
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,169
people to buy foreign products, because

339
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:14,870
we were intentionally going to produce

340
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,720
shabby cars in America, so that people

341
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,129
would buy Japanese cars, and of course, in 1969

342
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,409
that most people would have thought that

343
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:23,840
was crazy talk, but what did he say along

344
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:26,149
that line, with the idea that this would

345
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,610
then justify the shifting of American

346
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:31,730
industries to foreign countries? - yeah,

347
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:36,019
this was to establish the global economy,

348
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:41,870
the idea be we would have one global

349
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:44,659
worldwide commercial system. It wasn't

350
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:47,690
his term, originally, but he alluded to

351
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:50,690
what they call "The Declaration of

352
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:54,500
Interdependence", I think it was

353
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:57,259
Buckminster Fuller, who wrote that, it's sort

354
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,639
of a parody or take-off on Thomas Jefferson's

355
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:02,389
"Declaration of Independence" for our

356
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:05,090
country, and it's been a while since I've

357
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:07,279
read that, but the opening sentences of

358
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,799
"The Declaration of Interdependence" are

359
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:13,220
an echo of our "Declaration of

360
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:17,720
Independence", and the idea is that, every

361
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,629
part of the world should be involved in

362
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:26,090
a single economy, with different parts of

363
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:28,000
the world having emphasis on different

364
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:31,520
aspects of a global economy, and the

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,600
United States was to be the "Information

366
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:42,260
Center", our smokestack industries were to

367
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:46,400
be sent to other countries. - Then did he

368
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,530
explain, how that would come about? - Just

369
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,760
that the people, who make the

370
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:54,710
decisions, the captains of industry and

371
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,600
politicians, would get together and

372
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:02,929
decide, "we will close a steel mill here and

373
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,630
reopen it there." - Now what was this about

374
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:06,260
building in obsolescence to American

375
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,360
cars,

376
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,910
so they would break down, and people would

377
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,610
become disillusioned with our vehicles

378
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,150
and buy Japanese cars? - Yes, the idea was to

379
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:20,000
promote specifically the Japanese auto

380
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,400
industry. This was a principle that was

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,870
applied other ways, but they they wanted

382
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,740
to build up the hard industries in Japan,

383
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:34,160
and not eliminate hours, but

384
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:38,900
de-emphasize them. The way to do

385
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:42,440
this was, if you bought an American built

386
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,230
car, and the door-handle kept coming off,

387
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,150
as a window cracker fell off, or some

388
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,160
piece under the hood, that should have

389
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:54,320
been made of metal was made of plastic

390
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:55,880
and it would crack, and he would become

391
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,280
irritated by that, and then your neighbor,

392
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,350
who had a Japanese car, would say "well

393
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:04,910
I've driven this for so many years and

394
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:07,580
so many thousands of miles, and oh I just

395
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:11,390
change the oil and the tires." - And

396
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,670
they actually talked about this? - Well

397
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,059
yeah, he said, this was in the plans.

398
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:20,660
- This was the long-range plan, as of 28

399
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:22,730
years ago, to begin orienting American

400
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,980
stores buying foreign products, by

401
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,660
intentionally creating inferior products

402
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,309
in America. I know, my wife was saying the

403
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,500
other day, that she doesn't [heech?] to buy

404
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,260
any clothing made in America, because

405
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,720
it just falls apart, you know, the threads

406
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,820
come out, the buttons pop off, and you

407
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,400
know, she attributed this just to

408
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,770
accidental shoddy workmanship,

409
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,760
but you're suggesting that maybe there

410
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,100
was a

411
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,260
plan, at least as far as certain of our

412
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,530
products are, to discourage Americans for

413
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,870
buying them, to actually buy them

414
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:56,600
overseas, thus transferring America's

415
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,240
wealth industry and production to other

416
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,210
nations, as we then lose jobs here in

417
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:04,010
America? - Right, right. I remember this

418
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,980
particularly, because as a matter of fact

419
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,980
I probably was laughing to myself, as I

420
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,720
do now, when I recall it. - Thinking that we

421
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,610
could never get away with this. - Well I

422
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,640
was a child during World War two, and I

423
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,410
remember that, we always laughed at

424
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,140
things that were stamped "Made in Japan".

425
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,050
- Right, I remember that too. - And we were

426
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,110
very proud, that American-made goods were

427
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:28,790
more reliable and more enduring, and so

428
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,740
this was a complete about-face, that

429
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:33,790
which was made in Japan now is going to

430
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:38,300
be a superior product, and ours the

431
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:40,010
inferior product, and part of the idea

432
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:45,250
behind this was a psychological

433
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:49,070
preparation, that there's sort of a

434
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,480
should we say patriotism, you know "things

435
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,040
that are made in my hometown are the

436
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,720
best", "things that are made in my state

437
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,460
are the best". - "Things that are made in

438
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,750
America are the best, cuz we're the best

439
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,840
country in the world", and they were

440
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:04,070
trying to destroy that belief? - Yes, yes, so

441
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,430
that you would say "well I might be a

442
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:09,740
patriotic American, but gee, I can't

443
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:12,800
afford to be buying second-rate stuff,

444
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,530
when I can save money buying a foreign

445
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:20,210
import." so patriotism would take a

446
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:22,910
backseat to economy, you know, to my

447
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:27,620
personal economy, and this then would

448
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:30,470
break down the kind of loyalty to your

449
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:34,330
locale or to your nation, and foster a

450
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:38,560
more cosmopolitan "citizen of the world"

451
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,610
attitude. - "destroy the love of country." - aha.

452
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,250
- okay fine, I think that's such a

453
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:46,790
fascinating insight into the mentality

454
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,790
of these people, who seem to have such

455
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,740
tremendous power over education, over

456
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,830
industry, or even over our ways of

457
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,240
reproduction, today. [We heard many] sorts of

458
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,679
things did they talk about, I remember one

459
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,340
thing that you mentioned was, how they

460
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,870
were going to encourage sexuality, and if

461
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,480
they were going to try to get people's

462
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,580
minds oriented under sexuality, did they

463
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,170
talk at all about homosexuality, and

464
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:16,790
how that would be used? - Yeah, that

465
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:19,800
would be promoted, not just merely

466
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:23,580
tolerated or permitted, but actually to be

467
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:34,790
promoted, the idea being that no child

468
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:34,790
ever results from a homosexual union. the

469
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:41,580
business of morality, especially a

470
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:46,170
religious-based morality, really would

471
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:50,460
have no part in in this future, which is

472
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:52,410
the present now. - It's almost a laugh,

473
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,610
because it's so ridiculous, what is

474
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:59,309
transpired, and either laugh or cry. - Well,

475
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:01,580
you know, between then and now, it's been

476
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:04,980
quite an experience to watch this unfold

477
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,380
right according to the script right the

478
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,990
unfolding nightmares with moral

479
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,650
foundations about once great Christian

480
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:17,280
society are progressively undermined

481
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:18,870
consider this if we're going to have

482
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,020
babies without sex and sex without

483
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:25,470
babies then for a large part we

484
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,360
interchange the section sexist there's

485
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,120
no real difference between men and women

486
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,980
now did he stress that how we were going

487
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:38,670
to feminized men and masculinize women

488
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,150
hey more stressed masculinizing the

489
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,130
women and he did feminizing the men and

490
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:48,510
this would start in youth for example

491
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:50,340
one of the things he mentioned was the

492
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:53,400
toys that were available for children

493
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:56,910
would be changed girls would get

494
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:01,350
footballs and soccer balls and baby

495
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,880
dolls and tea sets in a little domestic

496
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:07,180
kits like a dustpan and broom

497
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,430
some that would disappear entirely and

498
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,210
other things like that would be very

499
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:15,870
very greatly de-emphasized the know was

500
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:19,330
trying to undermine the maternal or

501
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:23,050
these rather normal instincts that women

502
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:26,170
have for being housekeepers to get them

503
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:28,360
more out into the labor market and yeah

504
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,740
yes exactly and certainly if they're out

505
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,910
in the labor market they're not going to

506
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,950
be having children that's right if moms

507
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,750
at home and she's enjoying her first and

508
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,850
second baby she's likely to say well

509
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,700
it's time for third and fourth right and

510
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,190
I can take care of these kids because my

511
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,140
hubby's making reasonable living and we

512
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,120
can support them and of course now you

513
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,460
can't you have to have the woman working

514
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,210
because of the tax system and because of

515
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,190
the actual not in dollar amount but in

516
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:00,040
purchasing about decrease in the wages

517
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,500
of the average American working Bale yes

518
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,780
yes yeah the term they use is

519
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,490
discretionary spending and your

520
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,800
discretionary spending of course you

521
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:12,100
lose all discretion because the taxable

522
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,880
are protected and so your you're just

523
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:19,000
trying to survive

524
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,440
and then if mom has one or two children

525
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,640
that she worries about while she's at

526
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,400
work

527
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,080
that's enough worry for her so she's not

528
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,800
going to say well I'm going to keep my

529
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,040
full-time career and have more children

530
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,950
you know that's just gets too much to to

531
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,200
be concerned about take worrying about

532
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,730
daycare getting somebody to take care of

533
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,010
the children and so what we're really

534
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,530
talking about is an organized plan of

535
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:47,640
social engineering laid out many many

536
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,190
decades ago that is coming to fruition

537
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,590
really in the

538
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:57,470
elevating decades mm-hmm exactly

539
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,790
one other thing you wanted to develop a

540
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:00,980
little bit and then we could run and

541
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:06,920
that's the about the promoting of sexual

542
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:10,910
activity through in 1969 abortion was a

543
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:13,250
crime and every one of the states and at

544
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:16,130
that time he said well it won't be long

545
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:20,440
until abortion not only is no longer a

546
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:25,340
crime that will be seen as a right and

547
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:29,900
be tack supported which at that time

548
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:33,950
sounded incredible by promoting sexual

549
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:41,150
activity among youngsters and linking it

550
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:44,060
strongly to contraception planters

551
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,940
realized that more pregnancies were

552
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:51,480
covered the

553
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,130
idea then was that's okay if there are

554
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,010
more pregnancies that occur we'll have

555
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:59,400
an abortion back up and people who would

556
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,320
otherwise oppose abortion will change

557
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,789
their mind when they say well this is my

558
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:09,100
daughter who's pregnant

559
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:10,659
young and tender age and portion

560
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,509
restrictions might be okay for everybody

561
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:15,600
else so you were saying how they were

562
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:19,769
going to change our attitude towards

563
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:24,369
abortion and how in night Department in

564
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:27,039
1969 abortion was illegal in every state

565
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:30,279
so what did they plan how are we going

566
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,489
to change that well the idea is to

567
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:37,809
promote early sexual activity among the

568
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:40,359
kids connecting it strongly with the use

569
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:43,179
of contraceptives they would be taught

570
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:43,779
that the two just naturally should go

571
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:47,559
together

572
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:49,840
and with the realization that was more

573
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,090
sexual activity there would be more

574
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:57,489
pregnancies more contraceptive failures

575
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:59,649
one might say but no need to worry about

576
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:02,440
cluttering up the planet with unwanted

577
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:07,840
babies because abortion then would be

578
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:12,849
available as a backup and with young

579
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,690
girls getting pregnant too early in

580
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:20,049
their life people who otherwise would

581
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:22,539
maybe object to abortion when you know

582
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:25,690
if it was in somebody else's life would

583
00:30:22,539 --> 00:30:29,320
say video but I no longer Jack because

584
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,119
this is my daughter and I don't want her

585
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,960
to have to carry this pregnancy to term

586
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,190
because she's not yet mature enough to

587
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,700
to be a mother and take care of a baby

588
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:45,549
so it was sort of a win-win situation

589
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:48,820
for them it would break down resistance

590
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:51,869
to abortion as well as reinforcing

591
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:56,559
continually the need for contraception

592
00:30:51,869 --> 00:30:59,440
or sex without babies you know as you

593
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,029
talk about this it sounds so diabolical

594
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,390
almost like the plant had come right out

595
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:07,750
of the pit of hell yes

596
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,640
I think so and start looking back on

597
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,100
this as you've seen this unfolding over

598
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:14,020
the last 29 years or 28 years it must

599
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,080
have been terribly terribly frustrating

600
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,240
for you seeing these things and knowing

601
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,920
what was going on and yet realizing that

602
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,640
the vast majority of the American people

603
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:26,440
had no idea at all what was transpiring

604
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,270
what was frustrating and even talking

605
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,559
with some of my colleagues who heard the

606
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:32,410
same presentation

607
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:35,470
not very long afterwards they had all

608
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,090
seem to forget it they'd say oh yeah I

609
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,940
remember he was here I remember he

610
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,260
talked about some stuff but as far as

611
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,790
details and saying well don't you

612
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,809
remember when he said this that and the

613
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:50,220
other that's enough

614
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:53,340
did he say that well I don't know like

615
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:57,820
when I say that what comes to mind is

616
00:31:53,340 --> 00:32:03,010
one of my colleagues so dr. day had

617
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:06,640
spoken about the demise pill the demise

618
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:09,669
pill there there was consideration to be

619
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,140
given to an arbitrary age after which

620
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:17,320
you know everybody should just pass on

621
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:21,100
the age could be set by law 75 80 85

622
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:24,250
whatever seemed to be appropriate at the

623
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,500
time and then when you reach that age he

624
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:30,910
would be a candidate to take the demise

625
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:34,049
pill and he said this attitudes about

626
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:37,870
death needed to be changed and made more

627
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:39,970
quote realistic so you know we're all

628
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,919
headed for death one way or another so

629
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:49,780
why not do this in a very cerebral

630
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:52,600
scientific kind of way so the idea was

631
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,620
that when you had reached the legal age

632
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,510
you could have this nice banquet sort of

633
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:02,679
a farewell banquet with your family and

634
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:04,600
friends and afterwards go out and take

635
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:08,620
your demise pill and sleep away

636
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,659
peacefully oh one of my colleagues who

637
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,520
have we were

638
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:18,090
outside a meeting in the hospital and

639
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,740
there was some talk about he was having

640
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,690
some pain he was coming into the

641
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,600
hospital a ticket some tests and maybe

642
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,200
have some surgery acceptable hey Fred

643
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,730
what he closed - and might you know the

644
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,169
night before the operation maybe you're

645
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,940
a little restless and you can't sleep

646
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:36,600
and the nurse comes in and says well

647
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:39,029
here's your sleeping pill are you going

648
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,789
to take it if you take it maybe they'll

649
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:44,610
have to do the operation okay he just

650
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:46,049
left they he said did he say that I

651
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:48,179
didn't remember them I said yeah you

652
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:50,640
better remember he said it and so they

653
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:53,940
were even back in 1969 they were talking

654
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,710
about a more or less coerced or forced a

655
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:00,059
euthanasia did they talk at all about

656
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,870
other countries how they were going to

657
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,580
control population in other countries or

658
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:13,070
pause the possibility of fomenting

659
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:13,070
disease to control a population yes

660
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,480
there were there were a couple of things

661
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,639
there one there was a part of the

662
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:31,260
presentation where he said new diseases

663
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:34,830
will appear they will be very difficult

664
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,810
to diagnose doctor seeing these for the

665
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:40,770
first time of course will not know

666
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:45,000
what's going on and the reason I

667
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:48,210
remember this so strongly was I was

668
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,460
fairly new in practice and after hearing

669
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,919
him talk about new diseases that would

670
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,050
appear I'd have a youngster in the

671
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,609
office and be examining him and I you

672
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,980
know say - he's got disappear in these

673
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:00,780
symptoms and it just doesn't add up it

674
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,380
wasn't you know absolutely certain what

675
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,359
was going on well right away my memory

676
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,190
would ring a bell and say could this be

677
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,160
one of those new diseases he was talking

678
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,560
about well it turned out that that was

679
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,849
medication in my practice or with any of

680
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,839
my kids but in in retrospect I think he

681
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,839
was talking about AIDS

682
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,300
there were some other things that were

683
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,940
said that sort of lead me to that

684
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,400
instruction what other things rather

685
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,750
because of course my nature interest has

686
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,660
been the AIDS epidemic I've been

687
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,640
battling this for over a decade so one

688
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,380
of the things were there that if you can

689
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,690
recall it I know this is a long time ago

690
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:46,510
but I just think the Lord that you took

691
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,760
those notes and on the on the napkins

692
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:51,430
and then we recorded them what other

693
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,050
things did he say that made makes you

694
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,710
thinks that perhaps the AIDS epidemic

695
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:59,470
has something to do with it with a plan

696
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:02,890
the continent of Africa is a very rich

697
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:05,560
continent now that's what he said well

698
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,360
I'm sort of parallel lines right and I

699
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,230
don't recall that this was the in

700
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,900
immediate juxtaposition to AIDS but it

701
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,960
was pretty close okay so of course the

702
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,240
the AIDS epidemic is simply decimating

703
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,220
depopulating Africa the American people

704
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,470
don't know that but it's really

705
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,630
happening today and so was he talking

706
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,640
about possible disease Africa or just

707
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:31,570
the fact that it was such a rich rich

708
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,020
continent well here we have a world

709
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:38,020
that's soon to be overpopulated soon to

710
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:40,300
run out of natural resources and here's

711
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,790
this great big continent of Africa full

712
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,510
of resources

713
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:47,710
now this continent should not be left to

714
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,370
people who have never been able to

715
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,370
develop it

716
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:57,340
the continent should be under the

717
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,580
control of people who know how to

718
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,580
develop and manage all these resources

719
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:10,780
and in effect but what that means is you

720
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,560
have to get rid of the people that are

721
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,660
there now

722
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:18,390
not totally perhaps but in large part to

723
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,800
make room for the managers to move in

724
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,780
that's a frightening frightening thing

725
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,730
to contemplate and yet that's exactly

726
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:30,550
what is happening in Africa today and

727
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:35,530
the the interesting thing is that it's

728
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:41,770
always filled under concern love and

729
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:44,490
we're helping you out you know we love

730
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:48,340
all our fellow men but there were some

731
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:52,090
comments about let's face it not all

732
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:58,720
people are equal we all know that some

733
00:37:52,090 --> 00:38:02,770
people are not as smart not as capable

734
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,800
and capable of doing the only menial

735
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:08,230
tasks and there were some racial

736
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,480
illusions there now if you have a

737
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,570
continent full of people that are not

738
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,450
capable of doing what Europeans are

739
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,370
capable of doing or Europeans who have

740
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:21,550
become Americans are capable of doing

741
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:25,150
and then you can't leave such a large

742
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:27,280
rich continent under the control of

743
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:30,400
people that can't manage it the ultimate

744
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,720
in racism just hiding behind the the

745
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,870
banner of love and compassion yes yes

746
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,240
yes okay fine so basically he was

747
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,220
talking about the DC of these diseases

748
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,770
would be produced where they come from

749
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:48,190
these new diseases that were going to

750
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:52,660
come into society that was not explicit

751
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:55,330
at the time as I recall it I just the

752
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,810
best I can recall was it they would

753
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:01,270
occur that I kept wondering am I going

754
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,850
to miss them will I ever recognize them

755
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,349
or even will I get them right you know

756
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:09,339
what I myself succumbed

757
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:11,109
- something like that but in terms of

758
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:13,259
how this would be brought about I don't

759
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:16,569
think that was addressed at all okay so

760
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:19,359
we begin to see though an active program

761
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:21,759
that not just sort of passively bringing

762
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,400
about population control but actively

763
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:26,410
bringing about population control yeah

764
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,329
were there any other points that he made

765
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,979
as far as population control is

766
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:32,589
concerned but you know because these

767
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:35,049
ideas is so foreign to the average

768
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:37,630
listener the idea that we would have a

769
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:41,229
demise pill in other words we would kill

770
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:43,660
older people and now we would 1969 the

771
00:39:41,229 --> 00:39:45,430
idea that we would start aborting the

772
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,900
children of this country in mass numbers

773
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,450
was was so foreign

774
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,519
did he talk at all about pushing

775
00:39:49,450 --> 00:40:01,979
abortion towards certain racial or

776
00:39:51,519 --> 00:40:05,349
ethnic groups that sort of grew out of

777
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:07,479
talking about promoting drug use well

778
00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:09,430
let's get into talking about promoting

779
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:12,160
drug use because that is so important

780
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:16,140
especially today when we see drugs

781
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,140
destroying the inner cities of America

782
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:24,249
not everybody deserves space on the

783
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:30,819
planet not everybody deserves the right

784
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:33,369
to marry and reproduce so certain people

785
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:35,140
have to be sort of haunted and I don't

786
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,319
mean individual selection where you

787
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:41,619
identify a particularly human being but

788
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:45,819
certain populations with certain group

789
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:48,549
characteristics have to be shunted now

790
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:53,680
part of this grows out of transferring

791
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:55,239
industry overseas if I thought in terms

792
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,579
of our steel industry where a lot of

793
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:59,079
wage earners you know didn't have to

794
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:02,349
have a lot of education a lot of savvy

795
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:06,619
to do the work and earn a wage and raise

796
00:41:02,349 --> 00:41:09,059
a family but when these

797
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:17,730
industries are either closed or

798
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:20,670
transferred then the wage earners don't

799
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:28,260
have any other any place to go to earn

800
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:29,940
money to raise family women this was an

801
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,519
education guy I heard I learned a whole

802
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,549
lot there he said women are attracted to

803
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,750
men who are good providers see when I

804
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:38,960
was a kid they I thought they were

805
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:42,210
attracted to Clark Gable and

806
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,609
good-looking movie star and so this was

807
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,500
a really revelation of my age at that

808
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:49,109
time kids as women are attracted to men

809
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,710
who are good providers they don't much

810
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:55,140
care what a man looks like whereas men

811
00:41:52,710 --> 00:42:02,220
are more attracted to woman by her

812
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:07,470
appearance and also a man identifies

813
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:10,319
himself by his work and as I thought

814
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:12,740
about what he said many times in five

815
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,579
years I think that's absolutely correct

816
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:20,549
I'm Joe Blow I'm a welder I'm John Jones

817
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:22,849
I'm a stockbroker you know I think it's

818
00:42:20,549 --> 00:42:27,930
true we do tend to identify or socially

819
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:31,619
well if you have no job by which to

820
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:32,250
identify yourself you're not a good

821
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:37,069
provider

822
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:40,259
to attract a woman to become your wife

823
00:42:37,069 --> 00:42:44,430
then you're not going to have as great

824
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:47,309
an opportunity to bear children now if

825
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:50,960
you have a whole bunch of young men who

826
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:54,269
are unemployed are not good providers

827
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,660
you have no strong identity through

828
00:42:54,269 --> 00:43:00,839
their work you know what these guys do

829
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:04,890
when they get together well there's a

830
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:08,640
certain homosexual promotion there and a

831
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:10,290
certain you know falling into crime sure

832
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,920
which

833
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:16,800
now a consequence in which was

834
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,210
recognized well know by what you're

835
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,340
talking about crime what are you talking

836
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,190
about drug use other learners drug use

837
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:26,280
put in to come into this whole situation

838
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:27,690
okay now if you're young and you have no

839
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,050
job you have no family no

840
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,780
responsibilities and life is just a bore

841
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:36,690
and you're more vulnerable to abusing

842
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:42,090
drugs no did he suggest that they would

843
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:45,780
encourage drug use yeah yeah that is an

844
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:48,840
incredible incredible prediction of what

845
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,400
the direction that these people that dr.

846
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,990
day represented would be taking our

847
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,110
society because they had to have

848
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:59,190
powerful control a powerful influence

849
00:43:55,110 --> 00:44:06,600
over governmental positions and

850
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:10,200
governmental activities the idea was to

851
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,700
create sort of neighborhoods doesn't

852
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,760
seem like the right word anymore but

853
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:21,380
certain areas of the cities that would

854
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:24,990
be the jungle we have progressed so far

855
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:27,570
that their laws of natural selection no

856
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:31,320
longer operate this is sort of a near

857
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:33,830
quote paraphrasing there is natural

858
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,960
population control in previous years

859
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:41,900
predatory animals and Wars and disease

860
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:44,880
and such but now the technology has

861
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:48,870
nullified a lot of that this is part of

862
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,030
overpopulation so since the former law

863
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,670
of the jungle no longer applies we would

864
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:57,860
now have a new law of the jungle and the

865
00:44:53,670 --> 00:45:01,790
jungle would be certain areas in

866
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:06,110
primarily large metropolitan areas where

867
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:10,230
people just have no opportunity no hope

868
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:12,530
the areas would be allowed to

869
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,530
deteriorate

870
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:24,700
with the idea that as the spirit grew

871
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:26,650
and people sought refuge in drugs and

872
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,620
alcohol then a certain amount of

873
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:32,230
violence would be predictable and that's

874
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:37,510
okay because that would you know if you

875
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:41,800
died in 1969 because somebody shot you

876
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:45,460
or if you died in 1769 because a bear

877
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,570
got you a model and got you what's the

878
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,660
difference you're dead in either case

879
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,730
you succumb to the law of the jungle the

880
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,970
survival of the fittest on the other

881
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:57,820
hand means that in a time when you had

882
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:01,450
to be a crack shot with your musket and

883
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,970
you got the mountain lion the only

884
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,630
difference is in now instead of being

885
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:09,360
musketeer now you're computer genius

886
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,220
those are the criteria by which

887
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,470
Selectric survives and now of course

888
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,210
when dr. Dave was making all these

889
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,720
predictions and telling you what the

890
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:20,800
future held didn't he make some

891
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,770
reference to the fact that everything

892
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,040
was in place but nothing would stop this

893
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:30,520
at the present time and so he felt at

894
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:34,840
least somewhat able to reveal these

895
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:39,150
things to you yes yes that was very

896
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,150
early in the presentation that was said

897
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:49,180
that was 69 and as Beth I can recall

898
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,040
there there is no nothing specified is

899
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:54,490
exactly what was in place now that

900
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,650
hadn't been and he said something that

901
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,410
even as recently as five or ten years

902
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:03,430
earlier he could not have spoken with

903
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:06,250
such assurance about what the future

904
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:07,960
held and of course he went on then to

905
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,270
become some sort of an official or

906
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,700
planned parenthood he was at the time

907
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,830
when he spoke he he was medical director

908
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:17,260
of Planned Parenthood Federation of

909
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:19,269
America and he had been a professor at

910
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,859
the year medical school and he was

911
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:27,009
very well-known neonatologist yes yes

912
00:47:23,859 --> 00:47:28,630
and then he left here and went to

913
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:31,989
Planned Parenthood Federation in New

914
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,019
York became disillusioned there and I'm

915
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:40,239
not sure the nature that disillusionment

916
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:42,039
whether it was ideologic or what but he

917
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:45,459
did become disillusioned with them and

918
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:51,999
left and he seen his subsequently died

919
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:55,149
he's passed away yeah yeah he died mmm

920
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:56,709
Peter roughly eight years ago I'd have

921
00:47:55,149 --> 00:47:59,289
to look to see you as well

922
00:47:56,709 --> 00:48:01,839
so he never saw his dream come to

923
00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:04,539
fruition but certainly the people who

924
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,880
are and in sympathy with these ideas are

925
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:10,659
seeing it unfold today is America moves

926
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,439
into chaos and crime and drugs and new

927
00:48:10,659 --> 00:48:18,749
diseases developing all across America

928
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:21,369
so basically as you look back on this

929
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:23,559
what do you think possibly motivated

930
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:26,769
that dr. day to tell you these

931
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:30,669
incredible things everybody asked that

932
00:48:26,769 --> 00:48:32,139
question and I can only speculate they I

933
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:37,569
really don't know there was not an

934
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:38,769
opportunity to ask but they I think

935
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:42,959
there were a couple of things that were

936
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:46,929
involved one was that I think he had

937
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:49,329
divided feelings about this on the one

938
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:52,059
hand repeatedly saying this is the only

939
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:55,329
way there's no other alternative feeling

940
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:57,459
that some or another the human race

941
00:48:55,329 --> 00:48:59,979
would perish otherwise and that the

942
00:48:57,459 --> 00:49:03,189
human race should be provided to go on

943
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:05,829
well this this is a very common position

944
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:08,289
taken by elitist professor Quigley who

945
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:10,149
we have studied very extensively Bill

946
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:12,579
Clinton's mentor I really believe that

947
00:49:10,149 --> 00:49:14,889
we needed a ruling elite as Western

948
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:16,899
civilization would be destroyed and what

949
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:19,299
you're really describing is a ruling

950
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:23,040
elite with a program to try to preserve

951
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:28,170
at least some element of civilization

952
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:31,260
yes yes I think that's the the upfront

953
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:33,390
part of it and then in the intervening

954
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:38,460
years it has often occurred to me that

955
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:42,090
what also seems to underline this is a

956
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:44,820
more long-range look you know they talk

957
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:47,550
about progress of the human race we're

958
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:51,030
progressing and one should stop and say

959
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:53,070
well progressing toward what right and

960
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:55,050
especially when you hear somebody say we

961
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:58,550
believe now that we have the means to

962
00:49:55,050 --> 00:50:08,060
accelerate and control evolution

963
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:10,470
evolution toward what well I think one

964
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:14,520
possibility I don't know that I've heard

965
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:20,700
anybody state this explicitly is that we

966
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:24,300
will progress toward becoming gods that

967
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:30,450
sounds a little bizarre but when you go

968
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:33,390
back to Regenesis and they Adam and Eve

969
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:37,140
took from the tree of knowledge and the

970
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:38,910
serpent said ye shall be as gods in

971
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,010
other words what you're suggesting is

972
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:43,740
what energizes these people is a

973
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:45,960
spiritual force the idea that the

974
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:49,080
Serpent's message that ye should be as

975
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:52,470
gods if if you go along with my program

976
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:57,180
mm-hmm you can't evolve to a higher

977
00:50:52,470 --> 00:51:00,030
plane and as incredible as it may seem I

978
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:02,130
read many many publications by people

979
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,350
these are a Celtic and Luciferian

980
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:07,710
publications where this is the basic

981
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:10,320
underlying theme for mankind will

982
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:13,020
supplant God and bring utopia to the

983
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:16,200
world well well I'm thinking about the

984
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:19,170
book of Genesis when you go to the end

985
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,820
of that chapter and when God expelled

986
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:24,750
Adam and Eve and he said they they go to

987
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:28,200
the tree of knowledge verse or two later

988
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:30,350
he sets a cherubim in guard of the Tree

989
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,350
of Life

990
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:40,960
and I think about that you know we get

991
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:47,370
all this sperm banks and cloning of

992
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,370
animals talking about cross species

993
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:56,350
fertilization I often think about that

994
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:59,920
you know babies without sex and sex

995
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:01,810
without babies and early to be very

996
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,450
early in the game God set up a chair be

997
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,740
said they go to the tree of knowledge

998
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,810
I'm going to keep them away from the

999
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:10,510
tree of life just for fun go to Genesis

1000
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:13,960
and read that and and see whether you

1001
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:16,810
find any application to what's going on

1002
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,400
today well I think that this this is all

1003
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,290
prophetic I mean we see these things

1004
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,100
unfolding and and for people who don't

1005
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:26,590
understand order know the Bible these

1006
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:29,800
things seem impossible for those of us

1007
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:32,590
and I know you're a believer who CV

1008
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:35,740
Singh son further we see God's hand and

1009
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:37,990
we also see that the hand of the Lucifer

1010
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:39,340
in this whole incredible story well

1011
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:42,940
other any other points you'd like to

1012
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:47,230
bring out for our listeners well we were

1013
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:51,840
talking earlier about unisex stuff or at

1014
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:58,030
least I think we alluded to it the

1015
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,350
masculinization of women girls and I

1016
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:02,680
don't know whether you've noticed in

1017
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:05,350
your area but in our area in the last

1018
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,840
few years the sports pages are full of

1019
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:11,170
girls sports now the girls basketball

1020
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,880
you know and as if that true out here

1021
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,400
well yeah sure and we have a girls

1022
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,580
basketball teams the other you know

1023
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,890
Olympic girls basketball teams girls

1024
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:22,420
volleyball teams all of these things you

1025
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:26,350
know where they're so competitive as men

1026
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:27,820
mm-hmm soccer big thing out there no we

1027
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:30,510
don't have soccer out here to my

1028
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:33,310
knowledge it'll probably be coming

1029
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:36,690
women's soccer you speaking up well know

1030
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:40,590
women's and man okay bye probably Sunday

1031
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:44,940
co-educational so I don't know but

1032
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:47,510
the reason for this is that we can't

1033
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,520
have girls and lacy dresses smelling

1034
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,810
perfumey and attracting the men even if

1035
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,900
they're sweaty there nothing was

1036
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:56,670
attractive right right incredible

1037
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,740
incredible did he actually talk about

1038
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:05,400
things of this sort oh yeah that was

1039
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:06,930
very explicit girls would would be made

1040
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,960
less attractive because they would be

1041
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:11,580
just as you said sweating right full of

1042
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,250
you know sports and just like another

1043
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:19,680
guy rising big muscles and all those

1044
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:23,010
things so that was the one of the early

1045
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,890
parts of masculinizing women and then of

1046
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,840
course another part that I don't think

1047
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:31,920
he put in these terms by interpreting

1048
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,460
these terms then his a woman is a good

1049
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,850
woman

1050
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:38,220
to the extent that she mimics a man and

1051
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,660
that is leaving her home and you know

1052
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:43,650
going out into the workforce and

1053
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:45,750
becoming CEO or office manager some big

1054
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:51,600
outfit real estate I'm taking care of

1055
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:57,960
children but along with with the D Eman

1056
00:54:51,600 --> 00:55:00,420
izing of girls in the professional

1057
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:04,020
magazines that I get where drug products

1058
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:07,280
are advertised there's a one that shows

1059
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:09,600
all these girls in their soccer uniforms

1060
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,480
mud all over them their hair is all wet

1061
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,250
and stringy and this is held out to the

1062
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,650
young girls is you know this is what you

1063
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,960
ought to be this is what a I think young

1064
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,180
girl is she's a muddy soccer player I

1065
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,040
said because you know we can do anything

1066
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:25,290
the boys can do and we can do it better

1067
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,540
and the competition between women and

1068
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:29,820
then without realizing that we all have

1069
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:33,980
a placed and a part to play in in God's

1070
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:36,330
plan well I doctor denigan has been a

1071
